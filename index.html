		<h3> Future Plans </h3>
        <p> When I receive my bachelors degree in CS from Oregon State, I plan to find work either
		along the West Coast, or in Europe. Since travel has become a big part of my life, I'd ideally
		like to find a job where I can work remotely.</p>
		
		<h3> Travel </h3>
        <p> So far, I've visited a total of seven countries: Mexico, Ireland, Scotland, Poland, Germany,
		France, and Belgium. Much of my family lives in the central state of Aguascalientes, MX, making it my home away from 
		home. Ireland is another country I'm fond of; I spent a semester studying electronics engineering and computer science 
		there in 2016. It was during my semester there that I traveled to the other countries listed. During my next trip to 
		Europe, I'd like to visit Austria and Italy. I'd also like to return to all the other countries I've visited to see and
		learn more about their cultures.</p>
